LQG dynamics visualization

In Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG):
The quantum states on adjacent edges of the spin foam are spins,
representing the quantization of spatial geometry.
Through the Immirzi area/volume operator formula,
larger spin values on edges correspond to larger geometric areas/volumes.
In the visualization, thicker edges correspond to larger spin values,
which represent larger quantized areas/volumes
and stronger spacetime geometric fluctuations (stronger gravitational effects).
Note:
The quantum states at vertices are not spins but intertwiners,
which are mathematical structures connecting different spins at vertices.
Based on Clebsch-Gordon coefficients,
they ensure angular momentum conservation at vertices.
They can be understood as "glue" that determines how different spin networks
are "woven" together at vertices.
The figure shows the spacetime geometric dynamics of LQG.
